# CLI

Are you tired of running the virtual environment setup script? 
Or the git module commands to pull all modules? Or perhaps you have more multi-steps command that you have already written and lazy to type the full path?  

# Meet CLI

`cli` is a simple everyday cli with a simple mission. Save you keystroke and increase your project efficiency (& accuracy). Look at these benefits:

1. 📐Shorter. Better. Run shorter commands `setup`, `pull`, `module` with standardisation
2. 👯‍♂️ Same same! Stop saving script into dev/ or use different standardisation
3. ❌ No 3rd party script needed. Just use back the good default: `pip` and `python`
4. 🔋🔋🔋 Extra batteries will be included. Add on more scripts as you build along. Use an easy config file.
